# Cancer Survival Analysis (2013-2020)

This project analyzes UK cancer registry data to identify patterns in cancer incidence, treatment response, and 5-year survival outcomes. The goal is to understand which cancer types show higher or lower survival rates and how survival has changed over time.

### 🔍 Key Methods
- Data Cleaning: handled missing values, standardized cancer labels
- EDA: trend analysis by cancer type and year
- Statistical Survival Analysis: compared net survival vs Kaplan-Meier estimates
- Predictive Modeling: Classified cancers into high vs low survival categories

### 📊 Key Findings
- Skin tumors and testicular cancers show highest survival rates (>50%)
- Pancreatic & thoracic cancers show lowest survival (<25%)
- Trend analysis showed stable or improving survival for most cancer groups

### 🧠 Machine Learning Model
| Model               | Accuracy |
